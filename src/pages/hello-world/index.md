Welcome to my new blog, I hope you enjoy your stay!

## Who am I

I'm a simple tech enthousiast, who likes to mess around with tech things at work and at home.  I have some basic knowledge about microsoft technologies, linux, scripting, networking, etc.

## Why I started this blog

Simple, I wanted to mess around with some static site generators and learn some git.  
And also to have some sort of documentation for myself. When writing down the steps I took to solve an issue, it helps me to remember those steps in the future. Since we're always learning in the field we are in, it couldn't hurt to improve my learning capibilities.

## What will this be about

All the things I wanna learn. Improving my home network and automate some things. Implement some new tools to make my life easier or more secure. Find practical things to use the cloud for. Play around with some home made gadgets.
